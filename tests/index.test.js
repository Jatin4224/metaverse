//describe Blocks : In Jest, describe blocks are used to organize and group related tests into logical sections. This can be especially helpful for larger test files where grouping tests by function or feature improves readability and structure. Each describe block can contain individual tests (using test or it functions) or nested describe blocks for further sub-grouping.

describe("Authentication", () => {
  test("User is able to signUp", () => {
    const username = "jatin" + Math;
  });
});
